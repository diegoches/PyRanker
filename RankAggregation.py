# The RankAggregation class is a built-in type that works as a general 
# interface for all rank aggregation algorithms.
# The RankAggregation class has two attributes. The ranked lists and the
# number of ranked lists.  
# Every Rank Aggregation method has to inheritance this class and implements 
# the rank(self, ls_param) function.  
# \var ls_data The ranked lists are a list of lists where each element is a 
# dictionary with three keys: 'id', 'sim' and 'rank'. 
# The value for the key 'id' is the object's identifier; 
# the value of 'sim' is the related similarity to each object in the current 
# ranked list; the value of 'rank' is just the object's position in the 
# ranked list.
# \var int_numRanks The number of ranked lists.
