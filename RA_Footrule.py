##  The RA_Footrule class handles the Footrule method for Rank Aggregation.
#   This class inherits from the RankAggregation class, and implements the rank() function. 
#   The Footrule Optimal Aggregation algorithm is a good approximation of the Kemeny optimal aggregation, that can be computed in polynomial time.
