# The RA_MedianRank class handles a Median algorithm for Rank Aggregation.
# This class inherits from the RankAggregation class, and implements the
# rank() function.
# The Median algorithm finds the median of the positions from each object in
# each ranked list, and then it order them in ascending order.
