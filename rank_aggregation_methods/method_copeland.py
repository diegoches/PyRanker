# The RA_Copeland class handles the Copeland algorithm for Rank Aggregation.
# This class inherits from the RankAggregation class, and implements the
# rank() function.
# The Copeland algorithm compare each pair of objects and determine which one
# is more preferred. The more preferred object is awarded with 1 point.
# If there is a tie, each object is awarded with 0.5 point. After all
# pairwise comparisons are made, the candidate with the most points
# (the most pairwise wins) is declared the winner.
