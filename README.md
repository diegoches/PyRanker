# PyRanker
Rank aggregation library in Python. PyRanker have implemented 12 different rank aggregation algorithms.

# The Rank Aggregation
The rank aggregation problem is to combine many different rank orderings on the same set of candidates, or alternatives, in order to obtain a “better” ordering. 

# Technical Pre-requisites
- Python 2.7

# Rank Aggregation Algorithms
PyRanker have the following algorithms implemented:
- FootRule
- Borda
- Copeland
- Median Rank
- MScores
- Reciprocal
- CombANZ
- CombMAX
- CombMIN
- CombMED
- CombMNZ
- CombSUM

# How to Install
In Linux/MacOS:
1. Install pip
2. Within a console, go to the PyRanker project folder.
3. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
